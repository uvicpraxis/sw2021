## About the Prompts: Jentery Sayers 

Research motivated by ["Readers Are Listening,"](https://jentery.github.io/506v2/) a Fall 2020 graduate seminar at UVic

*How to move beyond, or expand, established modes of listening to media and literature?* Such established modes include Chion's causal, semantic, and reduced listening, for example. 

Outline of a listening prompt (designed by the UVic SpokenWeb team): 

* A listening mode 
* The cultural assumptions it addresses 
* The learning or experiences it affords 
* Primary source for practicing it
* A description of the primary source 
* Discussion questions 
* An experiment to conduct
